# 🤖 AI-Powered NLP Assistant

**Intelligent Text Processing with AI-Driven Workflow Detection**

A sophisticated Streamlit application that provides context-aware text analysis. Instead of generic metrics, this tool uses AI to detect your content type (e.g., social media posts, customer reviews, business documents) and applies a specialized analysis workflow to extract meaningful, domain-specific insights.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Core Intelligence
- **AI Workflow Detection**: Automatically analyzes your text and recommends the most appropriate processing workflow.
- **Specialized Analysis Modules**: Go beyond basic stats with dedicated pipelines for different content types.
- **Dynamic & Interactive UI**: The user interface adapts to your chosen workflow, presenting relevant charts and metrics.

### 🧰 Universal Analytics Suite
- **Comprehensive Text Statistics**: In-depth metrics including word/character/sentence counts, vocabulary richness, and readability scores.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Powered by VADER, providing compound, positive, negative, and neutral scores with clear visualizations.
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Identify top keywords, view frequency distributions, and generate interactive charts.
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing**: Clean your text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, stopwords, numbers, and extra whitespace.

### 📥 Flexible I/O
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Paste text directly, upload `.txt` files, or process entire columns from `.csv` files.
- **Smart CSV Handling**: Automatically detects delimiters and identifies text-heavy columns for analysis.
- **Multi-Format Export**: Download your complete analysis as a JSON report, export tabular data to CSV, or get a quick summary `.txt` report.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **📤 Input Your Content**: Choose your preferred method—direct paste, `.txt` upload, or `.csv` upload.
2.  **🤖 Run AI Analysis**: Click a button to let the AI analyze a sample of your content and detect its type.
3.  **🎯 Select Your Workflow**: Accept the AI's recommendation (e.g., "Social Media") or manually choose a different workflow.
4.  **📊 Explore Tailored Results**: Dive into a multi-tab dashboard where the primary tab is customized for your chosen workflow, showing specialized charts and metrics alongside universal analytics.

## 📋 Workflows in Detail

- **Features**: Citation detection, technical term identification, document structure analysis (e.g., abstract, references), and readability metrics.

#### 📰 News & Media
- **Ideal for**: News articles, press releases.
- **Features**: Named Entity Recognition (NER), topic classification, and fact extraction (future feature).

#### 📄 General Text
- **Ideal for**: Mixed or unclassified content.
- **Features**: A robust general-purpose analysis focusing on writing style, content structure, and readability.
